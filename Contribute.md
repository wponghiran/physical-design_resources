# Contribution Guidelines

To add content (a reference, a link, etc.) to the list, please use the following guidelines.

- Add content by creating a pull request and commits with useful titles.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Ensure you do not create a duplicate entry.
- The references/items should have the following **format**:
    - `Authors, *[Paper title](official link http://doi.org/xxx)*, conference/journal name, year. [Additional links: PDF, YouTube, Project page]`.  
       -- use a double space at end of line to make the line breaks
    - In the journal name, try to follow the [IEEE abbreviations](https://github.com/JabRef/abbrv.jabref.org/blob/main/journals/journal_abbreviations_ieee.csv).
    - **Try to follow a chronological order (publication date, oldest at the top) within each category!**
    - Link additions should be added to the primary relevant category. If the reference fits into multiple categories, do not duplicate the entry, just create a link to the item in the primary category, with the format `[Authors, Conference Acronym, Year](link to primary category)`.
    
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestions!
